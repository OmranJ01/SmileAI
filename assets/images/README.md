# Brushing Guide Image

To add the brushing guide image:

1. Place your brushing guide image in this directory (`assets/images/`)
2. Name it `brushing_guide.png` 
3. Uncomment the Image.asset code in `lib/screens/mentee/brushing_timer_screen.dart` (around line 361)

The image will then be displayed in the Brush Buddy timer screen to help guide users through proper brushing technique.

## Image Requirements
- Format: PNG (preferred) or JPEG
- Recommended size: 300-500px width
- Should clearly show brushing technique or tooth diagram
