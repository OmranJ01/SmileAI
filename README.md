# Gingival Disease App

A mobile platform that connects mentees, mentors, and doctors to provide personalized support, information, and guidance on gingival diseases.

- Admin console: manage users and assign mentors/doctors to mentees.
- Articles: admins publish trusted content; users access and filter by topic or severity.
- Reminders for medication and brushing.
- Scheduling for important events and appointments.
